1)Subject area: Transport. Problem: parking problems and congested city roads. Solutions: applications for smart parking management using artificial intelligence. Description of the startup: The startup offers an innovative solution for the effective management of parking spaces in cities. It is necessary to create an application that, using artificial intelligence, analyzes and predicts the availability of parking lots and finds a path for drivers to a free space. Application Features:

Real-time information about the availability of parking spaces in a specific area of the city. Building an optimal route for drivers to a free parking space, taking into account the current traffic situation.
Possibility to reserve a parking space in advance through the application.
Automatically determines parking time and calculates costs.
Notifications about the nearest last parking and reminders about the time when you need to rent a space.
Analyze data and provide statistics on the creation of parking zones to traditional authorities and parking owners to optimize the use of parking spaces.
Thus, the application will help drivers reduce the time they spend checking parking lots, reduce the flow of cars on the roads and increase the efficiency of using parking space in cities.

2) Subject area: Healthcare Problem: Lack of an effective Diptych system and management of chronic diseases in patients at home. How to solve: Create applications for chronic disease applications and management using artificial intelligence. Description of the startup: The startup offers an ideal solution for many people suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma and others. The use of artificial intelligence to identify and monitor a patient's condition provides them with personalized healthcare and support right at home. How it works:
System: The application collects data on the patient's disease indicators such as blood sugar, blood pressure, pulse, etc. using appropriate devices or sensors connected to the phone or wearable devices. Data Analysis: Artificial intelligence analyzes the collected data and identifies changes, anomalies or potential problems in the patient's disease state. He also gives advice and tips on staying healthy.
Personalized care: Giving patients recommendations based on their specific condition. It also provides access to a knowledge base on diseases, medical procedures and medications. Online Consultations: Patients can interact with various specialists through video call or chat, receiving consultations and advice in real time. Artificial intelligence helps doctors analyze data and provides them with additional information to make informed decisions. Advantages:
Improving the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases, ensuring access to non-mediated and personalized medical care. Reducing the frequency of visits to hospitals and clinics, medical costs for healthcare.
Improving treatment through ongoing disease monitoring and medication observations.
Possibility of early detection of deterioration of the patientâ€™s condition and prevention of complications. The startup has enormous potential to improve the lives of millions of people suffering from chronic diseases and provides both charitable and commercial value.
